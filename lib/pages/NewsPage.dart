He's also done consulting work for Vans and has several friends at the company, so it seems only right that he'd eventually get a Vans collaboration. In 2023, Nomura's TRIPSTER — an interior design company he co-founded in 2004 — worked with Vans on a three-pack of Authentics that was a full-circle moment for the creative polymath. "Honestly, I feel like I could have not changed them at all," he laughs. In 2019, I pitched them on the idea of making an Authentic in Japan, but since I wanted to do an American model, they said "let's do the collab in the US." Samples were supposed to be produced by the spring of 2020, but the coronavirus messed everything up. The sample came in late, and it didn't adhere to the specs I wanted at all, so I asked for another one to be made. By this point it was around 2021, and Vans moved their Asian headquarters from Hong Kong to Shanghai, which made a lot of people I was in touch with quit and further slowed the process. The next sample arrived about six months after that, and it still wasn't where I wanted it to be, so we kept going. It took about three and a half years in total to get to this point, so it's crazy to think we were originally planning on dropping the collab sometime in the winter of 2020.""",
